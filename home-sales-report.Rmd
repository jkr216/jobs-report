From David Rosenburg: 
The new home sales number, as bad as it was, was actually flattered by a 22% surge in spec buying. Actual sales of homes that were completed in July were detonated by 17%, and since March they have plunged at a 55% annual rate!

```{r}
test <- fromJSON("https://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/eits/ressales?get=cell_value,data_type_code,time_slot_id,error_data,category_code,seasonally_adj&for=us:*&time=from+2015-01&key=ed0d8732a88f640a0ee5e219f9ec11f2c53c5d5d") %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  `colnames<-`(.[1,]) %>% 
  slice(-1) %>% 
  mutate(cell_value = as.numeric(cell_value))

test %>% 
  filter(category_code == "ASOLD" &
         (data_type_code == "TOTAL" |
         data_type_code == "E_TOTAL")) %>% 
  select(date = time, cell_value, data_type_code) %>% 
  mutate(date = parse_date_time(date, orders = "Ym")) %>% 
  arrange(date) %>%
  spread(data_type_code, cell_value) %>% 
  mutate( up = qnorm(0.95, mean = TOTAL, sd = E_TOTAL/100*TOTAL),
          down = qnorm(0.05, mean = TOTAL, sd = E_TOTAL/100*TOTAL)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = TOTAL)) +

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
